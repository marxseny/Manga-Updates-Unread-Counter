# Manga Updates Unread Chapters Counter
This is a chrome extension that counts how many unread chapters you have on your Reading List on MangaUpdates.com

## Description
This extension changes the HTML of the Reading list page of your https://www.mangaupdates.com/mylist.html page.
It counts how many unread total chapters you have across x series and how many are up to date. Also, it provides additional sorting options depending on which Sort List option you chose (apart from With Priority, of course)


Example

Default Website:

Extension on:

It replaces the title of the Reading List with a message saying: "Total unread chapters: X in Y series. Z are up to date."
X being the sum of all unread chapters, Y being how many series are late and Z series are up to date.

It also adds how many unread chapters are in each series.
