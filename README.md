# Manga Updates Unread Chapters Counter
This is  a simple unpacked chrome extension that counts how many unread chapters you have on your Reading List.

## Description
This extension simply changes the HTML of the Reading list page of your https://www.mangaupdates.com/mylist.html page.
Example:

It replaces the title of the Reading List with a message saying: "Total unread chapters: x"
Also, it adds how many unread chapters are in each series. 
For example: If you're reading "Gintama", the website will display by default which chapter is the latest released. 
And the next column is which chapter you're at currently. If the latest chapter is 704 and your statuts is 26, this extension shows
"unread: 678" after the "Gintama (c.704)" section.
